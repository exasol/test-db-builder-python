===== Luigi Execution Summary =====

Scheduled 3 tasks of which:
* 1 failed:
    - 1 PrepareDockerNetworkForTestEnvironment(...)
* 2 were left pending, among these:
    * 1 were missing external dependencies:
        - 1 SpawnTestEnvironmentWithDockerDB(...)
    * 1 was not granted run permission by the scheduler:
        - 1 SpawnTestEnvironmentWithDockerDB(...)

This progress looks :( because there were failed tasks
