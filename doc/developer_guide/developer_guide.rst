Running the Integration Tests
-----------------------------

Exasol Integration Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Exasol dialect, the project uses the [`integration-test-docker-environment`](https://github.com/exasol/integration-test-docker-environment) (ITDE) which starts Exasol in a docker container and creates a docker network with a second docker container in which the tests run.
